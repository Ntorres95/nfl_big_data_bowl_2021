## Inspiration:

The NFL Big Data Bowl 2021 challenges individuals to identify unique and impactful approaches to measure defensive performance of drop-back plays from the 2018 regular season. Although the challenge is open ended, the NFL wants to explore what the data tell us about defending the pass play.
  
Some questions worth considering include:
 
What are coverage schemes (man, zone, etc) that the defense employs?

What coverage options tend to be better performing?

Which players are the best at closely tracking receivers as they try to get open?

Which players are the best at closing on receivers when the ball is in the air?

Which players are the best at defending pass plays when the ball arrives?

Is there any way to use player tracking data to predict whether or not certain penalties – for example, defensive pass interference – will be called?

Who are the NFL’s best players against the pass?

How does a defense react to certain types of offensive plays?

Is there anything about a player – for example, their height, weight, experience, speed, or position – that can be used to predict their performance on defense?

## Goals:

Our goal is to employ machine learning techniques to help us predict the outcome of a drop back play based on things like defensive formation, players in the box, yardline number, play direction, among other things.

## Methods:

The tools we will use inlude Pandas, Numpy, Os, Seaborn, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook. Additionally we will do a Logistic Regression, , and to determine which model best predicts the outcome of a drop back play based on a list of features.

More specifically, we will be using Sklearn's Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Classifiers will consists of categorical columns that indicate whether a play was complete (C), intercepted (IN), incomplete (I) or the quarter back was sacked (S).
